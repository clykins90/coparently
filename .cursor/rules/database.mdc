# Database Rules and Standards

## Connection
- Use environment variables for all database credentials
- Set up separate connection configurations for development, testing, and production
- Log database errors but not regular queries in production

## Models
- Each model should be in its own file
- Models should include comprehensive field validation
- All tables should use underscored naming (snake_case)
- All models should have proper associations defined
- Include appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields

## Schema Changes
- Never use `force: true` in production
- Use migrations for all schema changes
- Document all migrations with clear descriptions
- Test migrations in development before applying to production

## Data Integrity
- Use transactions for operations that modify multiple tables
- Define appropriate constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.)
- Use foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
- Set default values where appropriate

## Security
- Never store plain text passwords (use bcrypt or similar)
- Sanitize all user inputs before database operations
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Limit database user permissions to only what's necessary

## Performance
- Create indexes for columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses
- Avoid N+1 query problems by using eager loading
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Monitor query performance and optimize slow queries

## Backup and Recovery
- Set up regular automated backups
- Test restoration process periodically
- Store backups in a separate physical location
- Document recovery procedures

## Development Workflow
- Use seeders for development and testing data
- Never connect to production database from local development
- Use database versioning to track schema changes
- Review database changes before deployment
